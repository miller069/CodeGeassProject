"""
tile.py - Tile sprite class for the world map

Supports sprite_type values:
  'boundary'  — invisible collision wall (no image rendered)
  'grass'     — ground cover with a random grass image
  'object'    — world object (tree, rock, etc.) with a specific image
  'invisible' — alias for boundary (legacy name)

All tiles have a hitbox that is slightly inset vertically so that
the player appears to walk "behind" tall objects naturally.
